Welcome to assembli, an African Citizen History project. 

## What we are doing

We are building a website where people interested in an alternative version of history of Africa and its cultures can contribute to. We are working to collectively re-imagine events and narratives that have been passed down as African history based on access to hitherto unavailable, or non-widely shared information.

## The Problem

There seems to be a consensus that a big chunk of what is known as African history was largely skewed to represent the interests of the powers that be at various points over the last one hundred plus years.

Digital media(and the internet in general) and evolving interests and thoughts have seen the revelation, sharing and dissemination of information about the continent that was initially restricted to certain groups or individuals. Some of this information has brought into question a number of things that were taught as history.

## The Solution

In light of that, we feel like one platform-a website- where volunteers can collectively publish all these knowledge that is shared in bits on social media and other digital forums would not only provide a narrative that can shape another historical perspective but it would also harness this Pan-African spirit and provide a basis for people to re-imagine and re-construct new stories that could inform new identities.


## What We Need

You, in any way you can contribute.

We need help with user experience design, website design and development, figuring out the search functionality, fundraising, community building/development, sourcing and documenting “stories” and any other way we might not have pointed out but whose need you can identify and feel can help address. For the time being, you can reach us by [dropping us a message on Twitter](https://twitter.com/assembliafrica).
