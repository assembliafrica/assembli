# African Citizen History Roadmap

# Project Mission

Working with Afrophiles to unearth and document most of precolonial African experiences, and re-imagine colonial and post-colonial African history through African lens. We hope to build a destination for alternative narratives about the continent and its cultures that Afrophiles and others can use to re-shape their perceptions of themselves and of the continent.

#### We are working open because; 

1. we believe this is technically a public and shared resource. 
2. We believe the sheer scale of the project can only be achieved through collective intelligence.
3. Because we wish to develop a version that is not motivated by interests that hope to gain financially and politically by shaping the narrative a certain way.
